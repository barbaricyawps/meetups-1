# Decision log

The following document describes the history of all governance decisions over
time, listed in descending order from newest first:


## 2020-1-27 - Rename program to Quorum

- **Description** - Rather than call the program "quarterly remove regional
  meetups," we will call it "Quorum" (QRRM) for short.
- **Impact** - Will make the program name easier to remember and reference.
- **Agreed to by** - Original quorum participants.
- **Source** - Proposed by Rose and decided during the initial program kickoff
  meetings held on October 19 and 27. Also discussed in Slack with no
  objections.
