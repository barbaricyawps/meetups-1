# Decision log

The following document describes the history of all governance decisions over
time, listed in descending order from newest first:

## 2020-11-15 - Meeting frequency and schedule

- **Description** - Our quarters will consist of the following schedule:

  | Q  | Months    |
  | -- | --------- |
  | Q1 | Feb-April |
  | Q2 | May-July  |
  | Q3 | Aug-Oct   |
  | Q4 | Nov-Jan   |

  As a general rule, meetups will occur the first month of the quarter with the
  second month of the quarter acting as a backup if needed. We'll have a
  planning meeting the last quarter of the month to plan the logistics for the
  upcoming quarter.

  We'll offer speakers Monday through Thursday as the range of acceptable days
  of the week for presentations.

- **Impact** - Provides a consistent schedule for meetups throughout the year.
- **Agreed to by** - Majority of quorum participants.

  list. General meetup schedule proposed by Alyssa and agreed to on the mailing

## 2020-11-04 - Create mailing list for cross-communication

- **Description** - In addition to our Slack channel, we'll cross-post to a
  mailing list: [wtd-quorum on groups.io](https://groups.io/g/wtd-quorum)
- **Impact** - Will provide a record of our discussion for archiving purposes
  since Slack doesn't have that capability.

## 2020-10-27 - Rename program to Quorum

  meetups," we will call it "Quorum" (QRRM) for short.
- **Impact** - Will make the program name easier to remember and reference.
- **Agreed to by** - Original quorum participants.
- **Source** - Proposed by Rose and decided during the initial program kickoff
  meetings held on October 19 and 27. Also discussed in Slack with no
  objections.
