# Decision log

The following document describes the history of all governance decisions over
time, listed in descending order from newest first:


## 2020-11-04 - Create mailing list for cross-communication

- **Description** - In addition to our Slack channel, we'll cross-post to a
  mailing list: [wtd-quorum on groups.io](https://groups.io/g/wtd-quorum)
- **Impact** - Will provide a record of our discussion for archiving purposes
  since Slack doesn't have that capability.
- **Agreed to by** - Original quorum participants.
- **Source** - Proposed by Rose and agreed to in Slack.


## 2020-10-27 - Rename program to Quorum

- **Description** - Rather than call the program "quarterly remove regional
  meetups," we will call it "Quorum" (QRRM) for short.
- **Impact** - Will make the program name easier to remember and reference.
- **Agreed to by** - Original quorum participants.
- **Source** - Proposed by Rose and decided during the initial program kickoff
  meetings held on October 19 and 27. Also discussed in Slack with no
  objections.
