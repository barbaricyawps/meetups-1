## What is Write the Docs Quorum?

The Quorum program brings together various Write the Docs meetup chapters that
are in a common time zone to provide quarterly "super" meetups over Zoom
throughout the year. These are quarterly regional remote meetups, hence the
name: QRRM.

Write the Docs is running the Quorum program as a pilot in the U.S. East Coast
region for 2021. If the pilot program is successful and there is sufficient
interest, Quorum might expand to the U.S. West Coast and EMEA regions later
in 2021 or 2022.

The following U.S. East Coast meetups are currently participating in Quorum:

- Atlanta, GA
- Austin, TX
- Boston, MA
- Detroit, MI/Windsor, CAN
- Durham, NC
- Florida
- Philadelphia, PA

Meetups are held quarterly. On a rotating basis, a different meetup will be
responsible for the quarterly super meetup.

If it is safe to do so (cornavirus notwithstanding), individual chapters
can still meet in person during the off months for social networking or for
their own local educational presentation events. Individual chapters are also
welcome to organize in-person events to view the super meetups.


## Responsibilities of participating meetups

Participating meetup organizers agree to:

- Find a speaker for one approximately one event on a rotating basis.
- Either emcee or find an emcee for their event.
- Help promote each regional event with their meetup members--not just the month
  that they arranged the speaker.
- Attend as many regional super meetups for your region as possible.
- (Optional): It could help to have 1-2 core team members who can assist in
  coordinating the Zoom calls and communicating with meetup organizers.


## Advantages of participating

Participating in WTD Quorum has many potential advantages:

- **Sharing the workload** - Volunteering as a WTD meetup organizer can involve
  a lot of work depending on how much support you have from the members and
  other organizers in your chapter. Quorum super meetups can take some of the
  pressure off by reducing the number of meetups you have to coordinate on your
  own.
- **Attracting high quality speakers** - Because remote attendance increases
  audience sizes, high quality speakers can be better guaranteed they will have
  a good audience. Remote meetups can also attract high quality speakers by
  allowing them to present from their preferred location, reducing the burden on
  their time.
- **Expanding access to high quality content** - Some meetups have a greater
  pool of potential high quality presenters to draw on than others simply
  because of geographic density. Remote meetups allow WTD members from less
  dense geographic regions to have access to good content without needing to
  attend in person.
- **Reducing the need for venues or sponsors** - In-person meetings usually need
  a venue or sponsor to be successful. Coordinating sponsors and venues is
  frequently challenging for meetup organizers. Remote meetups donâ€™t have these
  needs.


## How to participate in Quorum

We can launch a new quorum in a region if we have at least 4 or more meetups
in a given region that are interested in participating.
